    "description": "West Beirut (1998), directed by Ziad Doureiri, is a Lebanese drama film set during the Lebanese Civil War, specifically in 1975. The film shows the story of a sixteen year old boy named Tarek living in Beirut, navigating through drastic and chaotic changes in his environment. The film is presented through Tarek's perspective, which gives a naive lens of the violence and political confusion that seizes the country. \n\nTarek and his two friends, Omar and May, spend their days trying to maintain a sense of normalcy, despite the war breaking out around them.",
